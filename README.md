## Description

AS A developer
I WANT to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection
SO THAT I can reliably retrieve them for later use

WHEN you open my application in my editor
THEN you should see a client server folder structure

WHEN you run `npm run start` from the root directory
THEN you find that my application should start up the backend and serve the client

WHEN you run the text editor application from my terminal
THEN you find that my JavaScript files have been bundled using webpack

WHEN you run my webpack plugins
THEN you find that I have a generated HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file

WHEN you use next-gen JavaScript in my application
THEN you find that the text editor still functions in the browser without errors

WHEN you open the text editor
THEN you find that IndexedDB has immediately created a database storage

WHEN you enter content and subsequently click off of the DOM window
THEN you find that the content in the text editor has been saved with IndexedDB

WHEN you reopen the text editor after closing it
THEN you find that the content in the text editor has been retrieved from our IndexedDB

WHEN you click on the Install button
THEN you download my web application as an icon on my desktop

WHEN you load my web application
THEN you should have a registered service worker using workbox

WHEN you register a service worker
THEN you should have my static assets pre cached upon loading along with subsequent pages and static assets

WHEN you deploy to Heroku
THEN you should have proper build scripts for a webpack application

## Installation

Run this application by:

npm install or npm i
